## Colors

This preset supports the following colors from the
[Theme UI color scheme](https://theme-ui.com/theming#colors):

| Key          | Description                                                                                          |
| :----------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `text`       | Text color. Should have AAA contrast with `background`.                                              |
| `background` | Background color. Should have AAA contrast with `text`.                                              |
| `primary`    | Primary brand color for links, buttons, etc. Should have at least AA contrast with `background`.     |
| `secondary`  | A secondary brand color for alternative styling. Should have at least AA contrast with `background`. |
| `highlight`  | A background color for highlighting text. Should have at least AA contrast with `text`.              |

You can customize these colors in your project with the `colors` key. There are
different ways to go about choosing colors. You can start with an
[expertly-crafted pallette like Tailwind's](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors).
Or use a pallette generator like [Palx](https://palx.jxnblk.com/). Use
[Colorable](https://colorable.jxnblk.com/) to determine the constrast between
two colors.

## Contributing

Work with two terminals. In the first terminal run

    yarn workspace @maiertech/preset run watch

and in the second terminal run

    yarn workspace docs run dev

The first command watches for changes in the `@maiertech/preset` workspace and
bundles the `@maiertech/preset` package whenever it detects changes. The second
command launches the docs, which use the local `@maiertech/preset` package as
dependency.
